    "description": [
      "Calculates a  grid of specific catchment area which is the contributing area per unit  contour length using the multiple flow direction D-infinity approach.  D-infinity flow direction is defined as steepest downward slope on  planar triangular facets on a block centered grid. The contribution at  each grid cell is taken as the grid cell length (or when the optional  weight grid input is used, from the weight grid). The contributing area  of each grid cell is then taken as its own contribution plus the  contribution from upslope neighbors that have some fraction draining to  it according to the D-infinity flow model. The flow from each cell  either all drains to one neighbor, if the angle falls along a cardinal  (0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2) or ordinal (pi/4, 3pi/4, 5pi/4, 7pi/4) direction,  or is on an angle falling between the direct angle to two adjacent  neighbors. In the latter case the flow is proportioned between these two  neighbor cells according to how close the flow direction angle is to  the direct angle to those cells. ",
      "Using  the grid cell size as the contribution at each grid cell assumes that  grid cell size is the effective contour length in the definition of  specific catchment area and does not distinguish any difference in  contour length dependent upon the flow direction. The resulting units of  the specific catchment area are then length units the same as those of  the grid cell size.",
      "If the    optional outlet point shapefile is used, only the outlet cells and the    cells upslope (by the D-infinity flow model) of them are in the domain    to be evaluated.",
      "By default    Dinfinity specific catchment area is evaluated using checks for edge    contamination. This is defined as the possibility that a contributing    area value may be underestimated due to grid cells outside of the domain   not being counted. This occurs when drainage is inwards from the    boundaries or areas with \"no data\" values for elevation. The algorithm    recognizes this and reports \"no data\" for the contributing area. It is    common to see streaks of \"no data\" values extending inwards from    boundaries along flow paths that enter the domain at a boundary. This is   the desired effect and indicates that contributing area for these grid    cells is unknown due to it being dependent on terrain outside of the    domain of data available. Edge contamination checking may be turned off    in cases where you know it is not an issue or want to ignore these    problems, if for example, the DEM has been clipped along a watershed    outline."

      "This tool combines the functionality of the \"Peuker Douglas,\" \"D8  Contributing Area,\" \"Stream Drop Analysis,\" and \"Stream Definition by Threshold\"  tools in order to generate a stream indicator grid (1,0) where the streams are  located using a DEM curvature-based method. With this method, the DEM is first  smoothed by a kernel with weights at the center, sides, and diagonals. The  Peuker and Douglas (1975) method (also explained in Band, 1986), is then used to  identify upwardly curving grid cells. This technique flags the entire grid, then  examines in a single pass each quadrant of 4 grid cells, and unflags the  highest. The remaining flagged cells are deemed 'upwardly curved', and when  viewed, resemble a channel network. This proto-channel network sometimes lacks  connectivity, and/or requires thinning, issues that were discussed in detail by  Band (1986). The thinning and connecting of these grid cells is achieved here by  computing the D8 contributing area using only these upwardly curving cells. An  accumulation threshold on the number of these cells is then used to map the  channel network where this threshold is optionally set by the user, or  determined via drop analysis.",
      "If drop analysis is used, then instead of providing a value for the  accumulation threshold, the accumulation threshold value is determined by  searching the range between the Drop Analysis Parameters \"Lowest\" and \"Highest\",  using the number of steps in the parameter \"Number\". For the science behind drop  analysis, see Tarboton, et al. (1991, 1992), and Tarboton and Ames (2001). The  value of accumulation threshold that is selected is the smallest value where the  absolute value of the t-statistic is less than 2. This is written to the drop  analysis table text file. Drop analysis is only possible when outlets have been  specified, because if an entire grid domain is analyzed, as the threshold  varies, shorter streams draining off the edge may not meet the threshold  criterion and be excluded from the analysis. This makes defining drainage  density problematic and it is somewhat inconsistent to compare statistics  evaluated over differing domains."

      "This tool combines the function of the following tools: \"Slope Area  Combination,\" \"D8 Extreme Upslope Value,\" \"Stream Drop Analysis,\" and \"Stream  Definition by Threshold.\" It creates a grid where stream cells have a value of 1  and non-stream cells have a value of 0 using the area and slope threshold method  to determine the location of the streams. With this method, streams are defined  as beginning where an expression meets or exceeds a threshold (T). The  expression is calculated by taking the slope (S) raised to an exponent (m) and  then multiplied by the specific catchment area (a) raised to an exponent (n),  i.e, (S^m)(a^n) >= T. Once a stream begins, it continues downslope, from  there. This method was suggested by Montgomery and Dietrich (1992). (They used  the slope exponent (m) of 2, area exponent (n) of 1, and a threshold (T) of 200  m^2 in their study). Please note that specific catchment area (a) is the  contributing area per unit width (cell size) and has units of length. If  specific catchment area is used for A, the units are contributing area per unit  width (cell size), usually in m, so if the cell size is 15 m, a T equivalent to  200 m^2 is 200/15=13.3."

Edge contamination is defined as the possibility that a contributing area value may be underestimated due to the fact that grid cells outside of the domain have not been evaluated. This occurs when drainage is inwards from the boundaries or areas with \"no data\" values for elevation. The algorithm recognizes this and reports \"no data\" for the impated cells. It is common to see streaks of \"no data\" values extending inwards from boundaries along flow paths that enter the domain at a boundary. This is the desired effect and indicates that contributing area for these grid cells is unknown due to it being dependent on terrain outside of the domain of available data. Edge contamination checking may be turned off in cases where you know this is not an issue, or want to ignore these problems, if for example, the DEM has been clipped along a watershed outline."

There are three statictical methods that this  tool can use: maximum distance, minimum distance and weighted flow average over  these flow paths. A variant on the above is to consider only grid cells that  contribute flow with a proportion greater than a user specified threshold (t) to  be considered as upslope of any given grid cell. Setting t=0.5 would result in  only one flow path from any grid cell and would give the result equivalent to a  D8 flow model, rather than D-infinity flow model, where flow is proportioned  between two downslope grid cells. There are several different options for the way distance can be measured: the total straight line path (Pythagoras), the  horizontal component of the straight line path, the vertical component of the  straight line path, or the total surface flow path."

This function is designed  to aid in the determination of a geomorphologically objective threshold to be  used to delineate streams. Drop Analysis attempts to select the right threshold  automatically by evaluating a stream network for a range of thresholds and  examining the constant drop property of the resulting Strahler streams.  Basically it asks the question: Is the mean stream drop for first order streams  statistically different from the mean stream drop for higher order streams,  using a T-Test. Stream drop is the difference in elevation from the beginning to  the end of a stream defined as the sequence of links of the same stream order.  If the T test shows a significant difference then the stream network does not  obey this \"law\" so a larger threshold needs to be chosen. The smallest threshold  for which the T test does not show a significant difference gives the highest  resolution stream network that obeys the constant stream drop \"law\" from  geomorphology, and is the threshold chosen for the \"objective\" or automatic  mapping of streams from the DEM. This function can be used in the development of  stream network rasters, where the exact watershed characteristic(s) that were  accumulated in the accumulated stream source grid vary based on the method being  used to determine the stream network raster."

Also, if a few pits actually exist and so should not be removed, while at the same time others are believed to be artifacts that need to be removed, the actual pits should have \"no data\" elevation values inserted at their lowest point. \"No data\" values serve to define edges of the domain in the flow field, and elevations are only raised to where flow is off an edge, so an internal \"no data\" value will stop a pit from being removed, if necessary."
