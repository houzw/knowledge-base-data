  "description": "SWATis a river basin scale model developed to quantify the impact of land management practices on water, sediment and agricultural chemical yields in large complex watersheds with varying soils, land use and management conditions over long periods of time.  The main components of SWAT include weather, surface runoff, return flow, percolation, evapotranspiration, transmission losses, pond & reservoir storage, crop growth & irrigation, groundwater flow, reach routing, nutrient & pesticide loading, and water transfer.   SWAT is a public domain model actively supported by the USDA Agricultural Research Service at the Grassland, Soil and Water Research Laboratory in Temple, Texas. It provides a tool for determining impacts of climate and land  management on Water supply and water quality on  Watersheds and river basins",
  "extended_description": "SWAT is the acronym for Soil and Water Assessment Tool, a river basin, or watershed, scale model developed by Dr. Jeff Arnold for the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS). SWAT was developed to predict the impact of land management practices on water, sediment and agricultural chemical yields in large complex watersheds with varying soils, land use and management coditions over long periods of time.",

The minimum data required to make a run are commonly available from government agencies.\n Five of the input files required for a SWAT simulation are provided with the model--the plant growth database, tillage database, fertilizer database, pesticide database, and urban database. They are included in the interface downloads or may be downloaded individually from the web site--they are not included in the executable/source code downloads.  \n In addition to the five database input files, two other databases are provided to users: the soils database and the weather generator database. These databases are collections of soils and weather generator parameters for soils and weather stations in the United States.",

Other files that may be generated include pesticide summary file (.pso), Stream Water Quality Summary File (.wqo), Reservoir Summary File (.rsv), Lake Water Quality Summary File (.lqo) Other than the standard output (.std) file, the files produced during a model run are formatted as spreadsheets to facilitate importation of the data into spreadsheet software.\n The detail of the data printed out in each file is controlled by the print codes in the input control code (.cod) file. Average daily values are always printed in the HRU, sub-basin and reach files, but the time period they are summarized over will vary. Depending on the print code selected, the output files may include all daily values, daily amounts averaged over the month, daily amounts averaged over the year, or daily amounts averaged over the entire simulation period. \nEach subbasin and land use has daily surface runoff, ET, groundwater, sediment yield, nitrogen, phosphorus, pesticide and pathogen loadings.",
